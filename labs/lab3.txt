Write a Python program, saved in a file called lab3.py to do the following:

It contains a variable n, to which you assign some integer.
It contains a variable series, to which you assign some string of characters (Read Think Python 8.1)

if the variable series is equal to the string 'fibonacci'  (read Think Python 5.2 for comparison operators)
then compute and print the nth fibonacci number, as defined in lecture on Tuesday.

otherwise if the variable series is equal to the string 'sum'
then compute and print the sum of the numbers 3 + 6 + 9 + â€¦ + 3n
(read Think Python 5.6)

otherwise print the string "Invalid string"
